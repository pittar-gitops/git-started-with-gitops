# Git Started with GitOps

Getting started with GitOps can seem intimidating at first, but it doesn't have to be!  The key is to start simple and include more functionality as you go.

This repository is intended to help get you started in a phased approach.  

1. Install OpenShift GitOps Opertor (in each cluster)
2. Configure OpenShift GitOps / Argo CD
3. Start your first GitOps "mono repo" for admins.
4. Meet the "App-of-Apps" bootstrap application.
5. Managing multiple cluster tenants

[First: Install OpenShift GitOps](docs/01-install-gitops-operator.md)
